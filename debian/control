Package: libopm-upscaling1-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: libopm-upscaling1 (= ${binary:Version})
Provides: libopm-upscaling-dev
Suggests: libopm-upscaling-doc
Description: Porous media upscaling tools -- applications
 The Open Porous Media (OPM) software suite provides libraries and
 tools for modeling and simulation of porous media processes, especially
 for simulating CO2 sequestration and improved and enhanced oil recovery.
 .
 opm-upscaling provides tools for single phase and relative permeability
 upscaling. During upscaling effective parameters (like porosity,
 permeability, and capillary pressure) for a simulation on a coarser scale
 are computed from properties of a simulation on a fine scale.
 .
 Package provides the upscaling applications.
